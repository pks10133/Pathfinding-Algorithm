Optimal Pathfinder (A* Pathfinding Algorithm)

Project Overview
The Optimal Pathfinder is a tool designed to solve and visualize maze puzzles using the A* pathfinding algorithm. This project aims to achieve optimal performance and accuracy in finding the shortest path from a starting point to a goal in a maze-like environment. The A* algorithm combines features of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, making it efficient and effective for various pathfinding applications.

Key Features

    A Algorithm Implementation*: The core of this tool is the A* algorithm, which uses a heuristic to guide its search towards the goal efficiently. It maintains a balance between exploring new paths and exploiting known paths to minimize the total estimated cost.

    Advanced Data Structures: The implementation utilizes advanced data structures such as:
        Priority Queue: This structure allows for efficient retrieval of the node with the lowest cost, essential for the A* algorithm to function optimally.
        Deque: Used for managing the open and closed sets of nodes, allowing for fast addition and removal of nodes during the search process.

    Dynamic Visualization: Leveraging the PyMaze library, the tool provides dynamic and interactive simulations of the maze-solving process. Users can visualize how the A* algorithm navigates through the maze, highlighting the path found and the nodes evaluated.

    User Interaction: The tool allows users to input custom mazes and visualize the pathfinding process in real-time. This interactive feature enhances understanding of the algorithm's mechanics and performance.
